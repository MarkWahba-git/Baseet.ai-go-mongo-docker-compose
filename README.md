# Using Docker Compose

This section shows how to set up a hypothetical development environment involving a MongoDB database, a back-end service in Go and a static frontend site. 

## Installation

Make sure you have a docker environment 


## Usage

```
docker-compose up -d --build
```
Navigate to http://localhost:8081/ with your browser 

## Conclusion

These were just a couple of examples of why the world of containers is awesome. If you haven't already, give Docker a try. If not for production use, at least during development, because managing local installations of services is extremely unpleasant.
